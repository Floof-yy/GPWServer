# GPWServer
General Purpose Web Server (Or GPWS) is a platform for current and future projects that are web based. Currently it's planned to 'host'* a file transfer server.

[* I realise now an hour later that gitpages doesn't support FTP, i guess i'll just make it a link to a seperate FTP server.. Raspberry pi?]: #
